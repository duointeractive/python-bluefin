Changelog
=========

1.4
---

* Added an auto-retry mechanism to directmode. This is currently only used
  to retry when we encounter HTTP 408's from Bluefin.
* Added a max_retries keyword to V3Client's constructor. Defaults to 3 retries.

1.3
---

* Added a new V3ClientDeclinedException exception for directmode. This is
  raised when Bluefin sets an error code on an alternate 'status_code'
  attribute in the response.
* The 'message' attribute on the V3ClientDeclinedException features a
  "human-friendly" message. Bluefin spits out some pretty cryptic junk for
  the 'status_code' induced errors.
* To get the un-modified error message that came back from the Bluefin API
  (for any of our V3Client exceptions), you can now use the `raw_message`
  attribute on the exception. The `message` attribute is now replaced with a
  more friendly version for certain crappy error messages from Bluefin.

1.2
---

* Moved to the excellent requests library instead of urllib2.
* Error handling raises exceptions for directmode status_codes that are
  known to mark failed queries.

1.1
---

* Adding dataretrieval module.
* Additional unit tests.

1.0
---

* Initial release.
